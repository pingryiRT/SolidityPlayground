# Solidity Playground

## Purpose
This project is an playground for learning the solidity langauge, and the details of working with ethereum. None of these projects claim to be novel, and honestly, they may not even be useful.

## Projects
### InfoSwap

Facilitates adversarial parties trading information amicably by requiring security deposits in ether to be refunded after a successful swap.

### Resolution Keeper

Encourages users to keep new years resolutions by requiring a deposit that the user determines is worth the value of making the resolution. The deposit is incrementally refunded as the user proves that she has accomplished checkpoints toward making the goal.

### Pingry Wallet

Develop a Pingry organization wallet on the Rinkeby test network to allow the pooling of test funds.

### Peer Structure

Develop a peer structure that receives funds from any account, has its own public and private key, and is coded to gradually return ether to a fixed funding account.
